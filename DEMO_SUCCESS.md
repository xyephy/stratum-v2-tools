# Stratum V2 Proxy - Working Demo

## Achievement
Successfully built and deployed a working Stratum V2 mining proxy that:
- Translates SV1 â†’ SV2 protocols
- Integrates with Bitcoin Core v30
- Mines blocks with real hardware (Bitaxe)
- Generates custom pool signatures

## Stack
- Bitcoin Core v30.0rc2 (multiprocess mode)
- sv2-tp 1.0.2 (Template Provider)
- SRI Pool (patched for testing)
- SRI Translator
- Bitaxe hardware miner

## Results
- 18+ blocks mined in 2 minutes on regtest
- Custom signature: "SV2 Regtest Demo Pool"
- Hashrate: ~928 GH/s sustained
- Share acceptance: Working with patched difficulty

## Startup Commands
./START_DEMO.sh

## Known Issues
- Pool requires patch for low-hashrate testing
- Production needs difficulty adjustment fix

## Next Steps
1. Test on signet for network validation
2. Multi-miner testing
3. Add monitoring dashboard
4. Community beta testing
